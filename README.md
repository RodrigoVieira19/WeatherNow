## Introduction

- A simple website that displays weather forecasts for various cities, along with weather information. I used JavaScript and the "openweathermap" API, which allowed me to obtain accurate real-time weather data. This project was developed with the goal of improving my programming skills, especially in the area of consuming RESTful APIs.
